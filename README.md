## Log File Entry
Simple Python script for entering log files and saving them in a logbook directory. I have set this up for saving logs relating to cases.

Inspiration for this project: (https://routley.io/posts/logbook/)

## To Do

Currently path for the directory logfiles saved in is hardcoded. Need to change this to a var.
